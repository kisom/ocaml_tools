in trying to learn objective caml, i decided to try to write some system
utilities to learn how to be useful in the language. i have a feeling i'm
going to look back on this repo with embarassment later on, but c'est la vie.

utilities:
	wget: basic implementation of the GNU wget utility
	cat:  basic implementation of the UNIX cat utility
	wc:   basic implementation of the UNIX wc utility

libraries:
	common: module of common functions

make targets:
      all: builds all of the above binaries
      libs: builds the library collection
      clean: removes all libs and binaries

dependencies:
the tools require the following packages:
    * ocamlnet (http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/ocamlnet.html)
